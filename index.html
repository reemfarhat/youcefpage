    <h1>Black Muslims During Ramadan</h1>

    <h2>A Photoessay by Youcef Bounab</h2>

    <p> <strong> New York City — </strong> At Masjid Tajul Huda, a majority-Nigerian mosque in the Bronx, Abderafiou Boukari recently sat down after the Maghrib prayer. Ending a long day of fasting, he dug into platters of egusi soup and iyan swallows, which among other foods members made and brought almost everyday. </p>


   <p>Boukari, a man with an unfailing grin on his face, is from Togo. He previously lived in Algeria, where his adoptive father still lives, and France, which he left with his wife and little baby to come to New York a few years ago.</p> 

   <p> For him, Masjid Tajul Huda, unlike any other mosque abroad, feels closest to home. </p>

    <p>“It’s better here,” he said. He tangled his hands and raised them above his head: “Here, we’re united.” Then, following a moment of silence, he added, “It’s not like in France. In France, you pray and you leave. Here, no. It’s like we’re au bled.”</p>

   <p> Tajul Huda, also known as the Imole Adini Islamic Society of New York, is a small two-story walk-up that flanks a residential building and a supermarket on East 170th Street. It gives off the nature of a mere family house at first, where the men usually occupy the bottom floor and the women the upper one, while the kids take up both stories, running up and down the stairs incessantly. </p>
    
    <p>But the mosque’s proportions proved salutary, if anything, as the smallness of the space imposed an unbreakable sense of intimacy and familiarity. Over the past two decades, Tajul Huda grew into a de facto community center where members come even from out of state.</p>
    
   <p> Such is the case of the Bishi family, who would drive there multiple times a week during Ramadan, the holy month of fasting, and other holidays. Hafeezat, 22, is the oldest daughter of the Bishis. Her parents, first-generation Nigerian immigrants, are accustomed to visiting the mosque multiple times a year. </p>

<p> “When you come to this country, you want to be around people that are like you to some extent,” she said. “That’s why these masjids were erected.” </p>

<p>There are over 20 mosques in the borough of the Bronx. A significant number of these are predominantly West African, situated in or near Concourse Village —a neighborhood that has long attracted sub-Saharan migrants.</p>


<p>According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the government’s main statistical agency, more than 16 African languages are spoken in the Bronx alone. But that number, linguists say, doesn’t reflect the real extent of spoken languages in the borough as it doesn’t take into account different variations and dialects.</p>

<p>Among the Nigerians of Tajul Huda alone, Yoruba and Hausa can frequently be heard in conversations, but English and Fus’ha Arabic are spoken during sermons and readings. In a practice that is not widespread among religious institutions, the imam also proves a listener as a microphone is passed between members. Their talks touch on a variety of topics that spans local news and Jeff Bezos. Other practices, besides the act of worship, are networking, socializing, teaching, and learning from each other.</p>

<p>Other Gambian- and Ghanaian-majority mosques nearby serve very much the same purpose. When a number of them gathered to celebrate Eid al-Fitr in Clairmont Park across the street from Tajul Huda earlier this month, people from different mosques wore different dresses and kaftans. Families and groups wore the same colors and patterns, each representing a different mosque.</p>

<p>Despite adversities (tribal tensions in Nigeria are one example) and the many challenges that immigration impose, Tajul Huda and other mosques are as much beacons to their members as they are a symbol of resilience. They single-handedly keep a displaced group closely knit together.</p>
